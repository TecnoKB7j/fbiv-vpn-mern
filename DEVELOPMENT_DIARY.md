## Day 1 - October 1st, 2025 üåÖ
**9:00 AM - The Optimistic Beginning**

**Emmanuel**: "Alright team, Vue.js to React conversion. How hard can it be? We'll be done by lunch!"

*Famous last words.*

**10:30 AM - First Reality Check**

**Mike**: "Uh, guys? Vuex doesn't exist in React..."  
**Emmanuel**: "We'll use Context API! It's basically the same thing!"  
**Caleb**: "Can we at least keep the same color scheme?"

*Narrator: They could not, in fact, keep the same color scheme.*

**2:00 PM - The Lunch That Never Came**

Still working. Pizza ordered. Emmanuel discovers that Vue's reactivity system is NOT the same as React's.

**Mike**: "You know we could just use Redux..."  
**Emmanuel**: "Context API is fine! Stop being dramatic!"

**6:00 PM - First Major Breakthrough**

Authentication system partially working! üéâ

**Caleb**: "Why does the login button turn purple when you hover?"  
**Emmanuel**: "Because CSS is apparently my enemy now."

**11:47 PM - Emmanuel's Solo Session**

Team went home. Emmanuel still coding. Coffee supply running low. Talking to rubber duck named Gerald about async/await patterns.

*Gerald is a good listener.*

## Day 2 - October 2nd, 2025 ‚òï
**8:00 AM - Caleb's Discovery**

**Caleb**: "Emmanuel, did you sleep here?"  
**Emmanuel**: *keyboard marks on face* "Sleep is for people without bugs to fix."

**10:15 AM - The Great CORS War**

**Caleb**: "Nothing works! Everything is broken!"  
**Emmanuel**: "It's just CORS errors, calm down."  
**Mike**: "Did you try turning CORS off and on again?"

*This actually worked.*

**1:00 PM - Design Review Session**

**Caleb**: "Can we make the buttons more... button-y?"  
**Mike**: "What does that even mean?"  
**Caleb**: "You know, more... *makes vague hand gestures*"  
**Emmanuel**: "I speak fluent JavaScript, not interpretive dance."

**4:30 PM - Speed Test Implementation**

**Mike**: "The gauge should spin like a dial!"  
**Emmanuel**: "It's not a car dashboard..."  
**Mike**: "But imagine if it was!"

*30 minutes later, the gauge spins like a car dashboard.*

## Day 3 - October 3rd, 2025 üî•
**8:15 AM - The Account Page Incident**

**Emmanuel**: "Define 'broken'"  
**Mike**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'email')"  
**Emmanuel**: *dies internally*

**8:16 AM - The Promise**

**Emmanuel**: "It'll be a quick fix. 15 minutes, tops."

*Narrator: It was not a quick fix.*

**11:30 AM - Debugging Hell**

```javascript
console.log('user:', user);           // undefined
console.log('user?.email:', user?.email); // undefined  
console.log('WHY:', 'JUST WHY');      // WHY
```

**Caleb**: "Maybe the user doesn't have an email?"  
**Emmanuel**: "Everyone has an email, Caleb. This is 2025!"  
**Mike**: "Did you check if the user object exists?"  
**Emmanuel**: "Of course I‚Äî oh."

**2:30 PM - Victory At Last!**

**Emmanuel**: "I FIXED IT!"  
**Team**: "What was wrong?"  
**Emmanuel**: "...null pointer exception."  
**Mike**: "Didn't I suggest checking‚Äî"  
**Emmanuel**: "WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT."

**4:00 PM - Production Ready Declaration**

**Emmanuel**: "Alright team, we're production ready!"  
**Caleb**: "Are we though?"
