## 🆘 Troubleshooting - When Things Go Sideways

### 😤 PowerShell Being Difficult?
If npm commands are throwing a tantrum:
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator and type:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
*This tells PowerShell to stop being so paranoid! 😅*

### 🗄️ MongoDB Playing Hide and Seek?
Make sure MongoDB is running! Check:
- **Local MongoDB**: Is the service running?
- **Cloud MongoDB**: Is your connection string correct in .env?

### 🔌 Port Drama?
- **Backend**: Runs on port 5000 by default
- **Frontend**: Runs on port 3000 by default
- **Conflict?** Change the PORT in your .env file

### 📦 Node Modules Acting Up?
The nuclear option (works 99% of the time):
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json  # Delete everything
npm install                            # Start fresh
```
