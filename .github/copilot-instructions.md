# 🤖 Hey GitHub Copilot! Welcome to FBIV VPN! 

## 🎯 What You're Working With

You've just landed in the **FBIV VPN MERN Project** - a sophisticated VPN application that's been lovingly converted from Vue.js to a full MERN stack! 🚀

Think of this as your **digital VPN empire** with all the bells and whistles users expect from a professional VPN service.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture (The Good Stuff!)

```
📁 backend/     → Node.js + Express API powerhouse ⚡
📁 frontend/    → React app with Webpack magic ⚛️
📁 .github/     → Where you are now! (Configuration central) 🛠️
```

## 🚀 Development Workflow (How We Roll!)

### 🔧 **Backend Development** 
```bash
# Use the VS Code task: "Start Backend Dev Server"
# Or manually: cd backend && npm run dev
# 🎉 Server runs on: http://localhost:5000
```

### 🎨 **Frontend Development**
```bash
# Use the VS Code task: "Start Frontend Dev Server" 
# Or manually: cd frontend && npm start
# ✨ React app runs on: http://localhost:3000
```

*Pro tip: Both servers can run simultaneously for the full development experience!* 🔥
